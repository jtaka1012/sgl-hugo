Easy2Anki is an app that makes it easy to add English words to Anki.  
When you add a word, it can automatically pick up definitions from an English-Japanese dictionary so you can choose the one you want. You can also enter a sentence, select one word from it, and register both the sentence and the word at the same time.

You can add words not only from the app, but also from a web browser by selecting a word you want to save and using the Share button (Share Extension).

Saved words and settings are synced through iCloud as long as you use the same Apple ID.

For the English-Japanese dictionary, Easy2Anki uses [Kujirahand's English-Japanese Dictionary](https://kujirahand.com/web-tools/EJDictFreeDL.php).

To register words to Anki, [the Anki app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is required on iPhone and iPad. On Mac, you need both the Anki app and the [AnkiConnect plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159).
